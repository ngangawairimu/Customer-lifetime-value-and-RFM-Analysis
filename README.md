### Project : Customer-lifetime-value-and-RFM-Analysis
 
The goal is to analyze weekly revenue generated by users from their registration cohort, where registration is defined as the first visit to the website. This calculation helps track how different cohorts (users who registered in a specific week) perform over a 12-week period.
Key Steps:
#### Identify User Cohorts:
The first part of the query identifies the registration week for each user based on their first visit to the site. Each user is grouped into a cohort according to the week of their first interaction.
Calculate Weekly Revenue per Cohort:

#### The second part calculates the revenue for each cohort over a 12-week period:
- Week 0: Revenue generated in the same week as the user's first visit.
- Week 1 - Week 11: Revenue for each subsequent week after the user's registration.
#### For each cohort, the revenue is tracked and aggregated by week.
Revenue per Registration:
The final calculation divides the total revenue for each week by the number of users in the cohort, providing revenue per registration for each cohort across all 12 weeks.
Key Features:
- Tracks revenue by user cohort, based on their first visit.
-  Revenue is calculated and tracked for each cohort across 12 weeks post-registration.
-NULLIF is used to prevent division by zero when a cohort has no purchases in a given week.
### Use Cases:
- Business Insights: By analyzing cohort performance, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, retention, and how long users typically stay engaged after registration.

- Marketing Strategy: Marketers can use this analysis to tailor campaigns that target specific cohorts, increasing the effectiveness of customer retention efforts.

#### Conclusion:
This analysis helps businesses understand user lifetime value and the effectiveness of their acquisition strategies. By tracking revenue per cohort over time, businesses can optimize user engagement, retention strategies, and ultimately, profitability.
