### Project Summary: 
- In this project, I performed a detailed cohort analysis to estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by analyzing weekly revenue and registration cohorts, as per the instructions. The goal was to address the limitations of Shopifyâ€™s simplistic CLV formula by considering all user registrations (not just purchasers) and analyzing customer retention over a 12-week period.

#### Steps Taken:
Data Extraction and Preparation:

- I queried the turing_data_analytics.raw_events table to extract the necessary data for calculating weekly revenue and registrations.
The registration cohort was determined by the user's first visit to the site, tracked using user_pseudo_id.
Weekly Revenue by Cohorts:

For each weekly cohort, I calculated the weekly revenue per registration (i.e., dividing total revenue by the number of users who visited during a particular week).
- I adjusted the dataset to include all users, not just those who made a purchase, ensuring that the full scope of user activity was considered.
Cumulative Revenue Calculation:

- Using the weekly average revenue per cohort, I calculated cumulative revenue over time (up to week 12) to understand the revenue growth by cohort.
I calculated averages for each week since registration and derived percentage growth based on those averages.
#### Predictive Analysis:

- To estimate future revenue, I applied the cumulative growth percentages to predict the expected revenue for cohorts acquired after the final available week (2021-01-24).
- This allowed me to forecast revenue for up to 12 weeks for newly acquired cohorts, providing an actionable view of CLV growth.
Visualization:

#### The results were visualized in three charts:
Weekly Average Revenue by Cohorts (USD)
Cumulative Revenue by Cohorts (USD)
Revenue Prediction by Cohorts (USD)
Conditional formatting was applied to highlight trends and make the data easier to interpret.
